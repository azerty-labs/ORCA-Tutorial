 # ORCA / Part 3 / Intermediate

In this chapter, we'll look at some of the new features in Orca that allow you to develop new types of sequences and make them random. 

Orca is a beast when it comes to random patterns. In fact, the way Orca can select note information is infinite and it can become very chaotic while offering great control over that chaos. In this part we will look at how to control this chaos and how to let it go where it wants :)

### R for Random

Let's start with the random generator. This operator can produce random values in the given range when used as below:

```
<0>R<1>
  <2>
```
- `<0>` : is the **Min Value** - Minimum Random Value
- `<1>` : is the **Max Value** - Maximum Random Value
- `<2>` : is the **Output Value**

With it you can select a note value at random from a sequence, for example :  

```
.................
...1R4...........
....2C...........
..0D308TLOVECAFE.
...*:02L9........
.................
```

That's great, but we can do better with a single operator!

### Q for Query

The **Q**uery operator reads the values in the grid with an offset. As always, here is the instruction manual:

```
<0><1><2>Q<3>
        <3>
```

- `<0>` : is the **X Axis** - Horizontal axis coordonate
- `<1>` : is the **Y Axis** - Vertical axis coordonate
- `<2>` : is the **Length** - Give a length of the value to read
- `<3>` : is the **Zero Offset** - Place of the write without offset

This operator is very useful for retrieving information from tables. This information can be note values, global variables or even whole notes! This operator gives us the possibility to create a little **tracker**! Here with a nice random trigger :smile_cat:

```
......................
...1R3................
....2.................
....J.4C8.............
...D2.605Q.....:32L...
...*:32L.......:32O...
...............:32V...
...............:32E...
...............:32C...
...............:32A...
...............:32F...
...............:32E...
......................
```

### X for Write

This is the dual of the **Q**uery operator. When **Q**uery is just read, the **X** operator is written to given positions in the grid. Use it with care as it can easily destroy your grid.

```
<0><1>X<2>
     <3>
```

- `<0>` : is the **X Axis** - Horizontal axis coordonate
- `<1>` : is the **Y Axis** - Vertical axis coordonate
- `<2>` : is the **Value to Write** - Give a value to write in `x,y`
- `<3>` : is the **Zero Offset** - Place of the write without offset

Combined with the random operator, this can be really great. Here the notes in the tracker change continuously and are written by the **X** operator.

```
