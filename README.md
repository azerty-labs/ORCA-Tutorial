 # ORCA - Tutorial

> "Orca is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) designed to quickly create procedural sequencers, in which every letter of the alphabet is an operation, where lowercase letters operate on  bang, uppercase letters operate each frame."

This repository contains all the tips and parts needed to learn and play with the wonderful ORCA sequencer. The tutorial is divided into four parts:

- Part 1 - [**Setup**](./P1_Setup/P1_Setup.md)

  > This section explains how to set up the live coding environment for the lesson. All lessons work almost exclusively with VCV-Rack, a modular cross-platform eurorack emulator.

- Part 2 - [**Basics**](./P2_Basics/P2_Basics.md)

  > This part covers fundamental operators, structures and possibilities. By the end of the lesson you will be able to produce basic sequences and rhythms.

- Part 3 - [**Intermediate**](./P3_Intermediate/P3_Intermediate.md)

  > In this chapter, we will learn about some of the features of Orca that allow us to develop new types of sequences and make them random. 

- Part 4 - **Expert**

  > This last part is about why Orca is wonderful, and how to use it in a live situation as an expressive tool. All the tips from the live pros are here, so be sure to check your Orca prerequisites before reading it :)
